<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a highly experienced geologist with over a decade of comprehensive expertise spanning the oil and gas industry and government regulation.<br />
  My career began with pivotal roles at Chevron and the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, where I developed deep technical skills in subsurface mapping, reservoir characterization, and geological modeling.<br />
  This foundation provided me with a strong understanding of resource exploration and national-scale geological data management. 
  Currently, I serve with the California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) under the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOC), focusing on regulatory compliance and environmental stewardship. 
  My work is dedicated to ensuring safe and responsible energy development practices within the state.</p>

<p>Driven by a passion for innovation, I am actively transitioning my analytical and problem-solving skills into the field of web development.
  I recognize the critical need to bridge the gap between complex earth science data and accessible digital platforms.
  My goal is to leverage my geological knowledge to create robust, user-friendly applications for data visualization, regulatory reporting, and resource management.
  This new path is fueled by self-study in modern programming languages and front-end frameworks.
  I am confident that my structured approach and attention to detail will translate effectively to building high-quality software solutions.
</p>

<p>My unique professional trajectory allows me to serve as a bridge between technical geological science and practical digital solutions.
  The combined experience of corporate E&P, federal survey operations, and state-level regulation gives me a rare, holistic view of the energy sector's challenges.
  I am seeking opportunities to apply my domain-specific knowledge to projects requiring both rigorous scientific understanding and innovative technological application.
  I excel at translating complex requirements into clear, actionable development strategies.
  Ultimately, I aim to enhance efficiency and decision-making by integrating powerful geological insights with cutting-edge web technologies.
